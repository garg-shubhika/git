In Git, an alias is a custom shorthand for a longer Git command. It allows users to define their own command abbreviations for frequently used commands, making them easier to remember and type.

For example, you can set up an alias named `origin` for a remote repository URL. Then, instead of typing out the full URL every time you want to refer to that remote repository, you can simply use the alias `origin`.

Here's how you can set up an alias:

```bash
git remote add origin [remote_repository_url]
```

In this command, `origin` is the alias, and `[remote_repository_url]` is the URL of the remote repository.

So, when you see `git fetch [alias]`, `alias` refers to the custom name you've given to a remote repository URL using the `git remote add` command. For example, if you set up an alias named `origin`, you would use `git fetch origin` to fetch changes from the remote repository associated with that alias.
